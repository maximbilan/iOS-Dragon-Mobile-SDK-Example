Sample Text-To-Speech App
=========================
Included as part of the Dragon Mobile SDK is a sample Xcode project :file:`DragonMobileVocalizer`, which presents a basic, complete demo of the network-based text-to-speech synthesizer.

Before you use this sample application, you must replace the placeholder application ID and key with values provided by Nuance for your developer account.
You can obtain your ID and key from the Nuance Mobile Developer portal located at http://dragonmobile.nuancemobiledeveloper.com/.

	1. Open the file :file:`Classes/DMVocalizerViewController`.
	
	2. Replace the ``SpeechKitApplicationKey[]`` value with your key.
	
	3. In the ``setupWithID:host:port:useSSL:delegate:`` method, replace the ``ID`` parameter  with your ID.
	
	4. You should also verify that the host and port provided to that method match the host and port provided in the portal.
	
	5. You can now run the application: connect your device and select :guilabel:`Build and Run`.

Main Text-to-Speech View
------------------------
When the sample application launches, the main text-to-speech view is displayed.

	Main Text-to-Speech View

This view has three primary elements:

	* Two elements are under the Text heading: a text entry field for defining the text to be spoken and a control button to start and stop the speech synthesis process.
	
	* Under the Read Out heading is a read-only text field, which displays the text being spoken.

To start the text-to-speech conversion, enter the text of your choice and select the Read It button.
When playback begins, the text appears in the Read Out field.

Text-to-Speech Logic
--------------------
This sample application is a simple introduction to using the network-based text-to-speech APIs in the Speech Kit framework.
To maintain simplicity, the application was designed using Interface Builder.
All of the text-to-speech logic is contained within the ``DMVocalizerViewController`` implementation.

On execution, when the application finishes loading the main view from the nib file, the ``viewDidLoad`` method is called.
This method is used to configure the Speech Kit framework on application launch by calling the ``setupWithID:host:port:useSSL:delegate:`` method.
Note that the key has already been defined as a global value.

When you press the Read It button, a new ``SKVocalizer`` is created with the ``initWithLanguage:delegate:`` method, and speech playback begins via the ``speakString:`` method.
The button label changes to Stop, allowing the speech synthesis to be canceled.

When playback finishes successfully, the delegate method ``vocalizer:didFinishSpeakingString:error`` is called, and the button changes back to Read It.
This allows another text-to-speech request to be made.

If an error occurs, the error parameter is a valid ``NSError`` with a localized message.
